PriceChecker
============

A simple price checker built with meteor and intended to be run only on a personal server.


Details
-------
Right now, the only required dependency is [cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio), which I've included in the public folder. I know this is hackey and a back way to do it, but I just wanted to get the repo up for backup purposes at the moment, and I'll fix this when possible. Same goes for the possibility of using Meteorite for this app, since I think that would make it easier to install.


Required Packages
-----------------
She just needs the following packages to fly:

    http
    jquery
    bootstrap
    underscore
